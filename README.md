# sure-samples-js

This is a repository of samples showing how to integrate SURE.social with your website or service.

Right now there is only one, showing how to use SURE.social's doubly-anonymized "ad hoc" age verification. It is written in Javascript, but should be easy to port to any other language. See the documentation in the project folder for an explanation of how it works.

We use libsodium for our cryptography.
